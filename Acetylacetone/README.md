# Process Design & Patent Application Studies (CHE261A)

This repository contains chemical engineering course projects focused on 
process design and industrial synthesis of key molecules. Work includes 
reaction mechanisms, unit operation analysis, process flows, material balance, 
equipment design, and cost estimation documented in patent-style reports.

## Projects
- **Acetylacetone Synthesis (C5H8O2)**  
  - Designed industrial-scale process via Claisen condensation.  
  - Included unit operations (mixing, crystallization, extraction, distillation).  
  - Performed material balance and reactor sizing for 1000 kg/day capacity.  

- **Monochloroacetic Acid (MCAA) Synthesis (C2H3ClO2)**  
  - Process design via chlorination and hydrolysis routes.  
  - Optimized purity (>99%) using stripping, absorption, and crystallization.  
  - Conducted scale-up and equipment cost estimation.  

- **Ambroxol Production**  
  - Investigated pharmaceutical synthesis steps and unit operations.  
  - Documented solid-state reactions, centrifugation, drying, and purification.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Process design & scale-up  
- Reaction mechanism analysis  
- Material balance & equipment sizing  
- Cost estimation & economic evaluation  
- Technical report writing (patent style)
